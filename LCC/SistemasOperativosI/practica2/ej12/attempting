       †     If  the mutex type is PTHREAD_MUTEX_DEFAULT, the behavior of _p_t_h_r_e_a_d___m_u_t_e_x___l_o_c_k() may
             correspond to one of the three other standard mutex types as described in  the  table
             above. If it does not correspond to one of those three, the behavior is undefined for
             the cases marked †.

       Where the table indicates recursive behavior, the mutex shall maintain  the  concept  of  a
       lock  count. When a thread successfully acquires a mutex for the first time, the lock count
       shall be set to one. Every time a thread relocks this mutex, the lock count shall be incre‐
       mented  by one. Each time the thread unlocks the mutex, the lock count shall be decremented
       by one. When the lock count reaches zero,  the  mutex  shall  become  available  for  other
       threads to acquire.

       The  _p_t_h_r_e_a_d___m_u_t_e_x___t_r_y_l_o_c_k()  function  shall be equivalent to _p_t_h_r_e_a_d___m_u_t_e_x___l_o_c_k(), except
       that if the mutex object referenced by _m_u_t_e_x is currently locked (by any thread,  including
       the  current  thread),  the call shall return immediately. If the mutex type is PTHREAD_MU‐
       TEX_RECURSIVE and the mutex is currently owned by the calling thread, the mutex lock  count
       shall  be incremented by one and the _p_t_h_r_e_a_d___m_u_t_e_x___t_r_y_l_o_c_k() function shall immediately re‐
       turn success.

       The _p_t_h_r_e_a_d___m_u_t_e_x___u_n_l_o_c_k() function shall release the mutex  object  referenced  by  _m_u_t_e_x.
       The  manner  in  which a mutex is released is dependent upon the mutex's type attribute. If
       there are threads blocked on the mutex object referenced by  _m_u_t_e_x  when  _p_t_h_r_e_a_d___m_u_t_e_x___u_n_‐
       _l_o_c_k()  is  called,  resulting in the mutex becoming available, the scheduling policy shall
       determine which thread shall acquire the mutex.

       (In the case of PTHREAD_MUTEX_RECURSIVE mutexes, the mutex shall become available when  the
       count reaches zero and the calling thread no longer has any locks on this mutex.)

       If  a signal is delivered to a thread waiting for a mutex, upon return from the signal han‐
       dler the thread shall resume waiting for the mutex as if it was not interrupted.

       If _m_u_t_e_x is a robust mutex and the process containing the owning  thread  terminated  while
       holding  the mutex lock, a call to _p_t_h_r_e_a_d___m_u_t_e_x___l_o_c_k() shall return the error value [[EEOOWWNN‐‐
       EERRDDEEAADD]].  If _m_u_t_e_x is a robust mutex and the owning thread terminated while holding the mu‐
       tex  lock,  a  call to _p_t_h_r_e_a_d___m_u_t_e_x___l_o_c_k() may return the error value [[EEOOWWNNEERRDDEEAADD]] even if
       the process in which the owning thread resides has not terminated. In these cases, the  mu‐
       tex is locked by the thread but the state it protects is marked as inconsistent. The appli‐
       cation should ensure that the state is made consistent for reuse and when that is  complete
       call  _p_t_h_r_e_a_d___m_u_t_e_x___c_o_n_s_i_s_t_e_n_t().   If  the  application is unable to recover the state, it
       should unlock the mutex without a prior call to _p_t_h_r_e_a_d___m_u_t_e_x___c_o_n_s_i_s_t_e_n_t(), after which the
       mutex is marked permanently unusable.

       If  _m_u_t_e_x  does  not  refer  to  an  initialized  mutex object, the behavior of _p_t_h_r_e_a_d___m_u_‐
       _t_e_x___l_o_c_k(), _p_t_h_r_e_a_d___m_u_t_e_x___t_r_y_l_o_c_k(), and _p_t_h_r_e_a_d___m_u_t_e_x___u_n_l_o_c_k() is undefined.

       Applications  that  have  assumed that non-zero return values are errors will need updating
       for use with robust mutexes, since a valid return for a thread acquiring a mutex  which  is
       protecting  a currently inconsistent state is [[EEOOWWNNEERRDDEEAADD]].  Applications that do not check
       the error returns, due to ruling out the possibility of such errors arising, should not use
       robust  mutexes.  If  an  application is supposed to work with normal and robust mutexes it
       should check all return values for error conditions and if necessary take  appropriate  ac‐
       tion.

RRAATTIIOONNAALLEE
       Mutex  objects  are intended to serve as a low-level primitive from which other thread syn‐
       chronization functions can be built. As such, the implementation of mutexes  should  be  as
       efficient  as  possible, and this has ramifications on the features available at the inter‐
       face.

       The mutex functions and the particular default settings of the mutex attributes  have  been
       motivated  by the desire to not preclude fast, inlined implementations of mutex locking and
       unlocking.

       Since most attributes only need to be checked when a thread is going to be blocked, the use
       of attributes does not slow the (common) mutex-locking case.

       Likewise, while being able to extract the thread ID of the owner of a mutex might be desir‐
       able, it would require storing the current thread ID when each mutex is  locked,  and  this
       could  incur  unacceptable levels of overhead. Similar arguments apply to a _m_u_t_e_x___t_r_y_u_n_l_o_c_k
       operation.

       For further rationale on the extended mutex types, see the Rationale  (Informative)  volume
       of POSIX.1‐2017, _T_h_r_e_a_d_s _E_x_t_e_n_s_i_o_n_s.

       If  an implementation detects that the value specified by the _m_u_t_e_x argument does not refer
       to an initialized mutex object, it is recommended that the function should fail and  report
       an [[EEIINNVVAALL]] error.
